              <p>It can be a little daunting and confusing, at first, to bring your program to life outside your terminal box and do something on screen. The following projects have a purpose, and that purpose is to demonstrate ability to create a program that can be used by a person who has no idea how to create one. 
              <br>
              Personally, I enjoy my terminal boxes. They have certain beauty to them, to work purely with numbers. Regardless, I can create interface that anyone within a company could use for their own needs.

              <p>This little nifty program allows to quickly create personalized timesheets for each employee within the company. The program does not allow anyone to clock their hours before the starting time, but it does automatically erase lateness of less than 5 minutes. 
              <br>
              The program presented was prepared with simplified mock data. The program is capable of differentiating by months, weeks, and other time periods. Selecting specific date informs program to use the date as a starting point.
